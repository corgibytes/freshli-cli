Feature: analyze
    The primary user-facing command. This command will delegate to other freshli activities to accomplish its work. It will manage work queues to enable parallelization.

    ```
    freshli [global options] analyze [command options] <repo url>|<local dir>
    ```

    With no options specified, performs analysis locally, and then sends the results to the Freshli web app so that the results can be viewed at at URL that will be provided in the command output.

    Scenario: Run the analysis
        When I run `freshli analyze`
        Then the output should contain:
        """
        lorem ipsum
        """
